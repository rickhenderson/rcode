# Catbook.csv Sample Code
# Created by Rick Henderson
# Created on January 20, 2016
# This file serves as sort of a tutorial so that
# you can become familiar with basic R commands using a small
# dataset that is easy to understand.
# The catbook.csv dataset contains 6 rows and 4 columns.
# Only 1 row contains two values that are set to NA,
# and two other rows have a single NA value.
# This way you can become familiar with exactly how
# complete.cases() works
# Read in the data you want
catbook <- read.csv("catbook.csv")
# Display the variable names or column headings
names(catbook)
# Display the results if you want
catbook
# Create a logical vector of the complete cases
cleanCatBook <- complete.cases(catbook)
# Display the vector, or you can view it in the R Studio Environment
cleanCatBook
# We see that it considers ALL rows that contain 1 or more NA values to be a complete case.
